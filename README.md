# WatCal

Allows you to export your University of Waterloo class schedule to your calendar.

> Note: This will only work on the Fall 2016 schedule AND if you have a successful course enrollment.

Simply head over to Course Selection -> view my class enrollment results -> Fall 2016 and click on the `Download Schedule` link that will be displayed under `Successful Course Enrollment`. Please wait for about 5 to 10 seconds for the chrome extension to process your classes before clicking on the `Download Schedule` link.

You will be able to export your entire University of Waterloo class schedule, excluding Tests (as the venue is not updated yet), in one click. You can then import the generated iCalendar (.ics) file into many popular calendar applications, including Outlook, OS X Calendar, and Google Calendar. Note that your calendar's timezone should be set to **America/Toronto (UTC-05:00)** in order for the schedule to reflect the correct time.
